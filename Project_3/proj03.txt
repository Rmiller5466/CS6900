EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Program Information:
Total Processors: 4 Total Time: 0 N: 100000

Epsilon: .001
Iterations: 4
M = 518649 P = 200347
Estimation of Pi (Cube:Sphere): 3.458540
Estimation of Pi (Sphere:Cube): 2.988400
Method 2 converged

BEST RESULTS:

1)The best test runs were performed when using 8 cores with a N value of
   100,000.  The smallest value of epsilon before problems began was around 1e-10. 
   At this point the M/N calculation was taking 10 thousand or more iterations and 
   giving estimations not even close to the desired 3.14. 

2)All of my estimated values of Pi were right around the estimations listed in the 
  example above. In most cases, the program would reach convergence within the first 
  20 iterations.
  In more extreme cases of smaller epsilon, it easily took thousands of iterations 
  to converge.
